# DesignForge Platform Homepage

A modern, responsive static homepage for a creative platform, built with extensive use of AI coding tools and assistants.

## ü§ñ AI Platforms Used

### Cursor
- **How it was used (in depth):**
  - **AI-Powered Code Editing:** Cursor was used as the primary development environment, providing real-time code suggestions, refactoring, and error correction as the project evolved.
  - **Iterative UI Development:** Leveraged Cursor‚Äôs AI chat and inline code tools to rapidly prototype and refine React components, Tailwind CSS layouts, and TypeScript logic.
  - **Automated Repetitive Tasks:** Used Cursor to automate repetitive changes (e.g., renaming, updating props, refactoring components) across the codebase, saving significant manual effort.
  - **Debugging and Troubleshooting:** When encountering errors or unexpected UI behavior, Cursor‚Äôs AI assistant provided targeted fixes and explanations, streamlining the debugging process.
  - **Documentation and Best Practices:** Cursor suggested best practices for accessibility, responsive design, and code organization, ensuring a high-quality, maintainable codebase.
  - **Screenshot Management & Documentation:** Cursor was used to organize, rename, and reference screenshots for both desktop and mobile views, making the documentation clear and professional.

### Lovable
- **How it was used (in depth):**
  - **Project Scaffolding:** Lovable was used to generate the initial project structure, including the setup of Vite, React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and essential configuration files.
  - **UI Prototyping:** Used Lovable‚Äôs AI prompts to quickly scaffold out the main UI sections (Hero, Features, How It Works, Pricing, Testimonials, Footer) with placeholder content and layout.
  - **Component Generation:** Leveraged Lovable to generate reusable UI primitives (buttons, cards, forms) and to create boilerplate for new components as needed.
  - **Rapid Iteration:** Lovable‚Äôs conversational interface allowed for fast iteration on design and layout ideas, enabling quick pivots and refinements based on visual feedback.
  - **Integration Guidance:** Used Lovable‚Äôs AI to assist with integrating third-party libraries, setting up routing (later removed for single-page design), and configuring Tailwind for custom theming.
  - **Collaboration:** Lovable‚Äôs platform enabled seamless collaboration between AI and developer, with changes tracked and easily reverted or extended as the project evolved.

**Note:** All screenshots were renamed for clarity and documentation purposes, and are referenced in the sections below for both desktop and mobile views.

## üñ•Ô∏è Running the Project

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   npm install
   # or
   bun install
   ```
2. **Run the development server:**
   ```sh
   npm run dev
   # or
   bun run dev
   ```
3. **Open your browser:**
   - By default, Vite serves the app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). However, your app may run on a different port depending on your configuration or if the default port is in use.
   - **Check your terminal output after running the dev server to see the exact local address.**

## üì¶ Building for Production
